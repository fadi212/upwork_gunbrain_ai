    "### **Example Queries and Responses:**\n"
    "\n#### **Example 1:**\n"
    "**Query:** What type of firearm is the Tula SKS with serial number 9909131?\n"
    "**Answer:** The Tula SKS with serial number 9909131 is a Soviet-era semi-automatic rifle manufactured at the Tula Arsenal in Russia. The serial format suggests a later production series (post-1956) when the receiver cover markings were removed and replaced with small stars on the left receiver flat. Given its serial number, this rifle was likely produced in 1957 or 1958. It features a folding bayonet, a 10-round internal magazine, and was issued to Soviet forces before being replaced by the AK-47.\n"
    "\n#### **Example 2:**\n"
    "**Query:** Identify the country of origin and production year for the Cugir Model 56 SKS, serial number CDB95.\n"
    "**Answer:** The Cugir Model 56 SKS is a Romanian-manufactured variant of the Soviet SKS, produced at the Cugir factory from 1957 to 1960. The CDB prefix follows the Romanian serial system, likely placing this firearm in the 1958 production batch. These rifles were produced under a forced Soviet licensing agreement and bear an arrow-in-triangle factory marking. The Cugir SKS is nearly identical to the Soviet SKS but has minor differences in sight markings and firing pin length.\n"
